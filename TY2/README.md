TY_2: Resample dff data to have the same speed distribution.
This Jupyter notebook follows TY_1 and focuses on:

Resampling dF/F data to ensure the same speed distribution across conditions.
Analyzing novelty signals by comparing resampled dF/F across environments.
Examining correlations between dF/F and speed on a per-minute, per-environment basis.
